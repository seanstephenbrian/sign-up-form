# sign-up-form

I created this page as my submission for the Odin Project's "sign-up form" assignment. My form is a contact form for a fictional restaurant called Oeuf Frit Cafe. I used a combination of CSS grid and flexbox to lay out the form itself, and then focused on using smart design cues (in addition to the properties of the HTML form itself) to validate the form on the client side.

I wanted to create a very pleasant and professional design here. I used soft colors (selected to harmonize with the left-side background image, a painting by the Swedish artist Hanna Hirsch-Pauli), custom fonts, and a couple little dynamic flourishes. Overall, I'm really happy with the way it turned out and plan to further explore this sort of clean and gentle visual aesthetic.
